Feature:  first login wizard
  As a user
  I want to be informed about the basic features of ownCloud when I first log in
  So that I can get a basic overview about ownCloud

  Scenario: User logs in into ownCloud for the first time
    Given user "user1" has been created with default attributes
    When user "user1" logs in using the webUI
    Then the user should see the firstrunwizard popup message
    And the heading of the popup should be "A safe home for all your data"

  Scenario: Previously created user logs into ownCloud
    Given user "user1" has been created with default attributes
    When user "user1" logs in using the webUI
    And the user closes the firstrunwizard popup message
    And the user re-logs in as "user1" using the webUI
    Then the user should not see the firstrunwizard popup message
